    "\n",
    "This is an interactive Python notebook. The grey cells contain runnable Python code which can be executed with *Ctrl+Enter*. Make sure to execute all of them in the right order, since they built upon each other. You can also execute them all in the beginning using *\"Cell->Run all\"*. To get back to a clean state use *\"Kernel->Restart\"*.\n",

    "This first tutorial introduces waLBerla's basic data structures,\n",
    "by implementing a version of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life\" target=\"_blank\">Conway's Game of Life</a> cellular automaton.\n",
    "The _Game of Life_ algorithm is formulated on a regular grid of cells. Each cell can be in one of two states: _dead_ or _alive_. The time evolution of this game is a simple rule how to get to the next cell state by only using cell states of neighboring cells. For details see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life\" target=\"_blank\">the Wikipedia page</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before working with waLBerla we first start with a pure Python implementation of this algorithm using the popular <a href=\"http://www.numpy.org/\">numpy package</a>. If you are not familiar with that package, now is a good time to read up on it."

In waLBerla these update functions are called  _sweeps_, since they iterate (sweep) over the complete domain and update each cell separately. A crucial point here is that at each cell, we only have to access neighboring values, and, since we create a new temporary copy, all of these cell updates could in principle happen in parallel."
